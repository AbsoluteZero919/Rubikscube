We can also click and drag around to change the orientation of the cube.<br>

To execute this in a Linux terminal, the commands are:<br>
- To open the file: __gedit RCube.c__
- To compile the file: __gcc RCube.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm__
- To execute the file: __./a.out__

Make sure OpenGL is installed in the system to run this program.
